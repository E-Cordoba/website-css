                The lines, CASE: "It's not possible." COOPER: "No. It's necessary", are a reference to the famous quote,

                For a cornfield scene, Christopher Nolan sought to grow five hundred acres of corn,
                which he learned was feasible from his producing of Man of Steel (2013).
                The corn was then sold, and actually made a profit.
